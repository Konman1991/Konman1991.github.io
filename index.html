         <p style="font-size:200%;">
             I am currently a full-time college student at Florida Gulf Coast University. 
             This is my first year attending FGCU and so far it has been a memorable experience.
             I tend to be a cheerful and positive person and I really like to joke around. 
             You know what they say.. Laughter is the best medicine.
             I am what you call a dog person at heart and I will always be one. Dogs are the most loving and faithful companions. 
             Dogs are always happy and have a pure heart and soul. I am currently majoring in Software Engineering. 
             I chose this major because I was always interested in programming and coding. 
             I took some engineering classes in high school and I found them very informative.
             I may not be as experienced as some others going into this major, but I won't let that stop me from continuing on this journey.

            I have always been a hands-on kind of a person. 
            I used to draw sketches a lot when I was younger but now I do not do it as often. 
            However, I like to design and modify drawings as I did as I was younger. 
            I used to spray paint patterns and designs on items of mine that I felt were too plain. 
            I was fortunate to have an older gentleman to teach me the skills of woodworking. he was a great mentor and taught me to be even more creative.
            I was fortunate enough to have worked with him for almost 2 years. Due to my mentor I gained inspiration for the future to design guitars or basses from old and abandon wood.

        After graduation, I plan on finding a job as soon as possible. 
        Once I do, I can start saving up for future expenses, such as a place of my own. 
        I also want to give back to my parents for helping with so much by giving a portion of my income to them. 
        When I do get a place of my own, I would like to bring my dog to live with me. I miss my dog Khleo and she is great company. My hopes is to find employmenr with a sucessful software company and on the side I would like to start marking guitars and basses as a hobby. This would provide additional income.
